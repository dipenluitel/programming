for loop

Exercise 1:
Create a loop that runs from 0 to 9.
let i;for(i= 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

Exercise 2:
Create a loop that runs through each item in the fruits array.
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
for (x of fruits) {
  console.log(x);
}

While Loop

Exercise 1:
Create a loop that runs as long as i is less than 10.
let i = 0;
while(i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++
}

Exercise 2:
Create a loop that runs as long as i is less than 10, but increase i with 2 each time.
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
i = i+2;
}

Break and Continue
Exercise 1:
Make the loop stop when i is 5.
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
  if (i == 5) {
    break;
  }
}

Exercise 2:
Make the loop jump to the next iteration when i is 5.
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
