Exercise 1:
Multiply 10 with 5, and alert the result:
alert(10 * 5);

Exercise 2:
Divide 10 by 2, and alert the result:
alert(10 / 2);

Exercise 3:
Alert the remainder when 15 is divided by 9.
alert(15 % 9);

Exercise 4:
Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 15 (same as x = x + y).
x = 10;
y = 5;
x += y;

Exercise 5:
Use comments to describe the correct data type of the following variables:
let length = 16;          // number
let lastName = "Johnson"; // string
const x = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};                        // object
