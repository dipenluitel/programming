Exercise 1:
Insert the RGBA color value for a full red background color of the <h1> element, with no transparency.
<style>
h1 {
  background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1.0);
}
</style>
<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>

Exercise 2:
Use hue, saturation and lightness to set a background color of the <h1> element.
Set the hue to red, saturation to 100%, and lightness to 50%.
<style>
h1 {
  background-color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
}
</style>
<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>

Exercise 3:
There is also a method where we can specify the alpha channel as well as hue, saturation, and lightness, what is the name of this method?
<style>
h1 {
  background-color: hlsa(0, 100%, 50%, 0.3);
}
</style>
<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>
